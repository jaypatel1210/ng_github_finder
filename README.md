## Github Finder Web App

In the Web App I have used **Github API** to Search User Profile and Get the *Profile Data, All Repositories Details* etc  
Also used **Firebase Email, Password Authentication** for Sign up/in to the user  
`try it @ https://jaypatel1210.github.io/ng_github_finder`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
